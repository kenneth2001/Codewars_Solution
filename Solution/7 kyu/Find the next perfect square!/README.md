# Find the next perfect square!

## Description

You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the `findNextSquare` method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.  

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then `-1` should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

**Examples:(Input --> Output)**

```
121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square
```

## Test Cases

	121 -> 144
	625 -> 676
	319225 -> 320356
	15241383936 -> 15241630849
