# Pyramid Slide Down

## Description 

Pyramids are amazing! Both in architectural and mathematical sense. If you have a computer, you can mess with pyramids even if you are not in Egypt at the time. For example, let's consider the following problem. Imagine that you have a pyramid built of numbers, like this one here:

       /3/
      \7\ 4 
     2 \4\ 6 
    8 5 \9\ 3
    
Let's say that the 'slide down' is the maximum sum of consecutive numbers from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. As you can see, the longest 'slide down' is 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23

Your task is to write a function longestSlideDown (in ruby: longest_slide_down) that takes a pyramid representation as argument and returns its' largest 'slide down'. For example,
    
    longestSlideDown([[3], [7, 4], [2, 4, 6], [8, 5, 9, 3]]) => 23
    
## Test Cases

    [[75], [95, 64], [17, 47, 82], [18, 35, 87, 10], [20, 4, 82, 47, 65], [19, 1, 23, 75, 3, 34], [88, 2, 77, 73, 7, 63, 67], [99, 65, 4, 28, 6, 16, 70, 92], [41, 41, 26, 56, 83, 40, 80, 70, 33], [41, 48, 72, 33, 47, 32, 37, 16, 94, 29]]
    -> 696
